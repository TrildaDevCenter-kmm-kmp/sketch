* change: maven groupId changed to `io.github.panpf.sketch3`, so version 2.\* will not prompt to
  upgrade
* change: Changed the package name to `com.github.panpf.sketch` so it won't conflict with the 2.\*
  version

  use a new library
* improve: It is no longer required to use SketchImageView, any ImageView and its subclasses can,
  combined with custom Target can support any View
* improve: The Zoom function is split into independent modules that can be independently relied on,
  and the large image sampling function is refactored and multi-threaded decoding is faster.
* improve: The gif module now directly depends on the [android-gif-drawable] library and no longer
  needs to be modified twice, and can be upgraded by itself
* new: Added support for SVG
* new: Added support for Jetpack Compose
* new: Support for request and decode interceptors
* new: Refer to [coil] v2.2.0 version and combine it with the original functions of sketch. Compared
  with [coil], there are the following differences:

    * Sketch supports finer adjustment of image size
